# NLP Analysis of Shifts in Public Opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

## Overview
This repository hosts a project developed as part of the Natural Language Processing course at Aarhus University in Denmark. It utilizes Python and NLP libraries to scrutinize Reddit data spanning from October to December, aiming to detect shifts in public opinion regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The analysis connects these shifts with significant events, providing insights into how public sentiments evolve in response to geopolitical developments.

## Data
The dataset includes Reddit posts, comments, and upvote metrics over the specified two-month period. **Data is available upon request** for those interested in exploring or extending the analysis.

## Project Structure
- `1_Data-Analysis.ipynb`: Preliminary data analysis to understand dataset characteristics.
- `2_Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb`: Sentiment analysis to categorize the public opinion.
- `3_EDA_final.ipynb`: Final exploratory data analysis visualizing the results and identifying correlations with most of the major events.

## Getting Started
To explore this analysis:
1. Request access to the dataset by contacting the repository owner.
2. Ensure your environment is set up with Jupyter Notebook/Lab and necessary Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `nltk`, etc.).
3. Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter for a detailed walkthrough of the analysis.
